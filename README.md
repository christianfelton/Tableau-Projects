<h1>Gamers' Arena Project</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Business Context

Gamers' Arena is a website that provides information about video games. It keeps track of the games that have been released and their sales across various platforms and genres. Different genres, such as RPGs, shooters, multiplayer, action, and so on, would appeal to different audiences. Gamers' Arena has now implemented a feature on their website that allows gamers to subscribe to their platform on a month-to-month basis. They can play a limited number of games as long as they have a subscription.

Objective
As an analytics lead, you must design an interactive dashboard that helps the director of the company make a decision on a new sales model (a subscription model) that will attract more gamers to our platform. There are multiple questions to be answered in order to make the decision on the subscription model. For example, which games need to be given for the subscription and what would be the duration? In order to answer these questions, a dashboard needs to be created.
